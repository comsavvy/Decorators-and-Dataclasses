# Decorators in Python

This directory contains my learning base on decorators and dataclasses in Python.

### I learned more about decorators at Real python <a href="https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/">(Decorators)</a> and also dataclasses (<a href="https://realpython.com/python-data-classes/">Dataclass</a>) in Python

> **Real_Python gives me more clarity about Dataclass and Decorators in Python**

> **Thanks to them**
